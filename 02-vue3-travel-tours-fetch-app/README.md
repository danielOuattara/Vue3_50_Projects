# travel-tour-fetch-app

## About

This app is inspired by John Smilga from his Udemy React course.

Then I updated to Vue3. Next to come is the same application using Vue3 TypeScript

This is a simple app where 04 actions are made:

- on load the app fetch data about 5 travel tours from John Smilga's url: "https://course-api.com/react-tours-project"
- read more/less about any tour description
- filter out a specific tour
- re-fetch all tours data once tours list is empty
